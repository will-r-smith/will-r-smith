## Will Smith  -  @will-r-smith

I'm a Computational Mathematics MSc student at the University of Edinburgh with 1 year (full-time) of Python coding experience. I'm very interested in applied mathematics and its numerical applications involving data. 

I started to get into coding following my undergraduate dissertation for my mechanical engineering undergradute degree at Loughborough University and have since completed several courses on **Codecademy** including:

- Data Scientist: Machine Learning [Career Path]
- Feature Engineering [Skill Path]
- Build a Machine Learning Pipeline [Course]
- Learn Git & Github [Course]

I've also completed several large coding projects including:

- Modelling pollution levels in the UK using neural networks [Python].
- Modelling heat and mass transfer in lyophilisation using finite difference methods [MATLAB].
