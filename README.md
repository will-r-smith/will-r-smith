## Will Smith  -  @will-r-smith

I'm a Computational Mathematics MSc student at the University of Edinburgh with 1 year (full-time) of Python coding experience. I'm very interested in applied mathematics and its numerical applications involving data. 

My university dissertations:

- Undergraduate:
    - Computational heat and mass transfer analysis in Lyophilization (Finite Difference Method) to determine the optimal shelf coolant inlet conditions to ensure intra- and inter-vial heterogeneity [MATLAB].
- Masters:
    - Exploiting structured matrices in layer selective dense-to-sparse fine-tuning of large language models [Python].
